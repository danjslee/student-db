jucetsn8w9s2khqjucerualfw8we7tjm,elliot.roazen@gmail.com,"To be honest, and this is my fault, I was probably a bit too advanced for this beginners course. I have built quite internal apps for work, full-stack. And I play around with Claude Code daily, in terminal and in an AI IDE/terminal (Cursor and/or Warp). So I didn't learn anything new for coding with Claude Code, but it was awesome to learn how other people use it.","I didn't learn anything new because I was pretty advanced. But I think the three things I learned outside of the little internet bubble I reside in are:
- Most people have never, ever written a line of code, used a terminal/IDE, or thought about solving their problems through an engineered solution
- The LinkedIn/Twitter bubble vastly overestimates the number of people *really* using AI at work. At best, 99% of people are just generating text, one prompt at a time. 
- Even IF 10-20% of the general population of US workers started using these advanced applications of AI tomorrow... it wouldn't change things, because most people do not have ""product sense"", design taste, etc.",10,Very satisfied,10,"The best part about this course, is that Dan and the team treat you like an adult. They spend the first hour or so showing you how advanced users of Claude Code think about the software and how to approach problems. Then they help you install it and let you go–explicitly mentioning that if you encounter a problem or a bug, that you should try to figure it out yourself. This is perhaps the most important learning; firstly, that you *will* encounter problems (that's just the nature of engineering), and second that you should foster the curiosity and drive to solve the problems creatively. I would highly recommend this course to any professional that wants to separate themselves from the 99% of the world that are just using AI, one prompt at a time, as a glorified search engine. Instead, in just 7-8 hours, they will walk away as someone with an entirely new, powerful toolkit to build and create whatever they want.",I'm biased because I was probably too advanced to sign up to the beginners course. So I would say that I would LOVE if you could consider giving me a credit to take an advanced course when/if you drop it... because I would love to take that.,Definitely yes,"Product sense.

1 - Webpage reports with graphs >> .md / other
2 - You should literally just ask for specific styles to solve purple slop (Tufte, rams)
3 - Vibe coding lets us build super creative delightful UIs - I'd previously solved for function > form, but my favourite demos were star wars, windows 95, CoD, rather than necessarily most features",10,Very satisfied,9,"In a short day, you'll learn to use agents that can actually  do things for you on your computer, working with your files and without needing to switch to ChatGPT or a new app.","For me personally: I'd like more concrete learning/tips/examples for using Claude Code in daily work for true end-to-end tasks rather than just demos. That's why I signed up in the first place. I liked that we started with the NPS analysis, but I was disappointed that we moved on from it after having made a few pretty reports that we didn't really QC or build from. I personally would have gotten more value from this if we'd done something like (making it up):
- still start with NPS vibe analysis (real data was great!)
- explicitly work through how to harden it (strategies to make Claude more reliable + QC efficiently)
- enrich the data with web search or other information, using parallelization to make it quicker and higher quality
- draft and refine a report and 'email to our boss' from the data working with claude to get an output we're actually happy with // good quality & not AI-isms (you could even plug Spiral as part of this)
(or some other concrete, meaty project that touches on multiple capabilities and is clearly mappable to non-technical knowledge work)

The vibe coding piece is fun, but felt quite long and we've already had lovable/replit/bolt for a while. I'm not sure how much value a non-technical audience is actually getting from trying to vibe code a web app today.

Other suggestions:
- Consider providing a brief introduction or quick-reference further reading for things like parallelization, token budget etc. - at least so people know what they don't know. Being able to run tasks in parallel is what I find game changing about cc that you don't get easily in chatbot apps. This would also help with cases where participants don't move at the same speed - people who get further can move on to more advanced material and still feel like they're getting a similar learning curve to people who've never opened a terminal before
- Version control: I get why you didn't go into git, but people still need version control if only because of wanting a safety net. If there's a workaround you can give attendees (claude.md instructions to save versions in an archive folder?) I think that will help a lot",Definitely yes,"Both 1. daily life examples (see my feedback on doing end-to-end beyond just nice-looking demos) and 2. setting up useful personal software (moving from localhost one-shotted demo to having a db and an api, etc. etc.)",*Excellent* - felt accessible throughout,"Yes, see my feedback. I expected more on the daily-life skills usage of claude code (like analysing spreadsheets or making work reports), since this course was explicitly marketed at a non-technical audience.

I understand the enthusiasm people have for the prospect of vibe coding apps, but it's not realistically where they're going to get the most value especially since we didn't go beyond generating a superficial demo.

Rather than splitting the day in two, I would have preferred to go deeper into either topic (obviously my preference is the daily-life side, but I know others will prefer the other side). This was a great first course, but felt like it was trying to be many things to different groups of people",I had fun - I'll be on the lookout for what you do next!,completed,2025-11-22 11:22:24,,2025-11-22 12:10:22,50efa987ad,,"

That atmosphere, plus being surrounded by curious people, helped me build my first small projects and actually feel confident moving forward","1) I learned how to generate a full web interface from any block of text — something that wasn’t accessible to me in other LLMs in a way I would be satisfied.
2) I learned how to quickly visualize that content in completely different styles and layouts, and actually get the kind of clean, structured markup I wanted.
3) I learned how to iterate on a product in small, controlled steps — adjusting logic, design, and behavior without rebuilding everything from scratch",8,Very satisfied,8,"The real impact is longer-term: it gave me a clear path into how products are actually built. Now I can turn any idea into a working draft, iterate quickly, and cut down the time from concept to something real. It shifted my mindset and I’m no longer limited by the HOW only by my own imagination and taste","I think the biggest upgrade would be moving all the technical setup — installs, terminal prep, common errors — into a pre-reading + pre-session checklist. People come into the first session with a lot of energy, and nothing drains it faster than getting stuck on a terminal issue they’ve never seen before. If all the ‘friction moments’ happen before the live call, then the session itself can stay focused on building, experimenting, exchanging ideas, and getting feedback.

I’m saying this also from my own experience — I’ve run more than 150 practical AI workshops, and the pattern is always the same: the highest-energy moment needs to be reserved for creation, not debugging. You already handled support incredibly well, but shifting the prep earlier would make the whole experience even smoother and more empowering from the very first minute",Definitely yes,"In a follow-up course, I’d love to go deeper into areas that connect coding with actual product thinking. I’m really interested in how to design multi-step agent workflows, how to structure interaction logic, and how to translate abstract ideas into functioning product mechanics. I’d also love more on interface generation, visual articulation, and how to push Claude into more complex, user-facing prototypes.

First — I’d love a bit more visibility into why Claude makes certain structural choices when generating code or interfaces. As someone who studies AI interaction patterns, I’m always interested in the underlying logic, not just the final output.

Second, it would be helpful to have a quick, high-level comparison with alternative tools. Not benchmarks, just a one-slide overview of how Claude Code feels different from things like Lovable, Manus, or even the newest Gemini 3 capabilities. It doesn’t need to be scientific — even the team’s personal impressions would be valuable. It just helps contextualize strengths and use cases","ust one more thing: you did an amazing job with this course. It’s definitely on the pricey side, but it’s clear you know exactly which audience you’re building for.

From my own experience running 150+ practical AI workshops, I’ve seen that the biggest long-term value often comes after the sessions — through the continuous circulation of knowledge inside the community. If the Discord space for this cohort stays alive and has a bit of ongoing support or prompts from your side, people will keep building, sharing, and leveling each other up. And, honestly, a strong community becomes the most powerful word-of-mouth engine — in my case, it consistently brings up to 80% of new participants.

I think the onboarding was good and I will be copying patterns, and the first couple of exercises were thought out well (perhaps it would be worth including a section where you compare a base 'make this NPS thing' to 'use the teaching of Tufte to...'
However - the last call it 3-4 hours felt more like office hours with no structured guidance and phoned in. For folks that wanted to jam - great! But I can jam on my own time. I was hoping that the group that has written articles on 'compounding engineering' and talks through how claude code tends to over plan, over-test etc - would have shared some frameworks of key engineering concepts distilled into what you need to know as a vibe coder, and then specifics for 'how we get claude code to really hum' that we could take back. The course basically crapped out at your standard 'vibe coding intro' where you have a setup and first prompt, then a second that gets you to a web app. The whole day investment and price point (call it 200/hr) led me to believe we'd get further than that - the lovable folks got about as far as we got in 60 min. So - which I appreciate the effort into the start, there wasn't really follow through and the 2nd half of the course felt phoned in and not really useful. I recognized it was a 101 course - but I suspect I'm not the only one that feels this way.

ccn3g1iwlwdne7yccn3g66wunbx3beoh,bronson.elliott@gmail.com,Actually demystifying Claude Code for me. I was intimidated at first but Dan and the team were very encouraging,1. How to just get started with Claude Code. 2. How to create a new project. 3. How to use Plan mode before actually building anything (so important),10,Extremely satisfied,10,I'm a 50+ year old late career professional who is trying to reinvent myself with AI. Dan and the Every team were the perfect guide to introduce new concepts and topics that make you feel supported and confident to take on the challenge going forward.,Maybe provide users with a video tutorial along with the written instructions on how to install Claude Code and get up and running prior to the event. This will save a lot of upfront time getting everyone setup and ready while more experienced users have to wait for everyone to catch up?,Probably yes,More development best practices and methods for structuring and scaling projects. Perhaps even more complex topics like security and payment handling.,*Excellent* - felt accessible throughout,Would like to have had an overview of slash commands in Claude Code. Both the ones baked in along with making your own. Although that one might be for an intermediate course.,"Thank you so much for doing this. I know it's a lot to carve out a whole day for both the Every team but also all of the participants, but it really is appreciated.",completed,2025-11-19 22:32:43,,2025-11-19 22:44:23,4b8eb8e151,,"

There’s nothing holding you back.,Add a bit more like git and hosting.  Maybe have the class branch off based on how comfortable they are with current understanding.,Definitely yes,Build the 2nd brain system.     Maybe a custom gpt that teaches higher level stuff like auth.    Also ask everyone to list the their pain points before hand and work thru the top 20 or so.,*Excellent* - felt accessible throughout,Was hoping for a bit more about living docs and seeing the prompts every uses.  But I also need to rewatch the first two camps.  The first one went over my head when released but is probably perfect for me now.,"You guys are so inspiring!  This still feels so crazy that I’m able to develop software, and every articles/events always leave me feeling empowered to build
More.   I would love to play any kind of role in helping you guys grow and succeed.",completed,2025-11-19 22:31:58,,2025-11-19 22:45:53,642cde50da,,"
